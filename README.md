### **Summary: Bike Sharing Demand Prediction Using Multiple Linear Regression**  

#### **Problem Statement:**  
BoomBikes, a US-based bike-sharing provider, has faced revenue losses due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The company seeks to predict bike demand to optimize business strategies post-lockdown. This project involves building a multiple linear regression model to understand the factors influencing bike demand.  

#### **Business Goal:**  
The objective is to create a model that accurately predicts bike demand based on various independent variables, enabling BoomBikes to make informed business decisions and increase profitability.  

#### **Data Preparation:**  
- The dataset includes multiple independent variables, such as **season**, **weather conditions**, and **year (yr)**, which may impact demand.  
- Certain numerical variables, like **season and weathersit**, should be converted into categorical variables since they represent labels rather than continuous values.  
- The **year (yr)** variable, despite having only two values (2018 and 2019), should be considered in the model as bike-sharing popularity is increasing over time.  

#### **Model Building:**  
- The **target variable** is **cnt**, representing the total number of bike rentals (sum of casual and registered users).  
- A **multiple linear regression model** is built to analyze which factors significantly influence demand.  

#### **Model Evaluation:**  
- The model‚Äôs performance is assessed using **R-squared (R¬≤) score**, calculated as follows:  
  ```python
  from sklearn.metrics import r2_score
  r2_score(y_test, y_pred)
  ```  
- The R¬≤ score helps determine how well the independent variables explain bike demand.  

This analysis will help BoomBikes strategize its operations and improve service offerings based on demand predictions. üö¥‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
